### Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation-linux.md

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```{note}
Provide an NGINX monitor entry in your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/nginx:
    type: collectd/nginx
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/nginx` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/nginx]
    logs:
      receivers: [smartagent/nginx]
```

```{note}
Configure NGINX to expose status information by editing the NGINX configuration. See `ngx_http_stub_status_module` on the NGINX documentation site.
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/nginx
   ...  # Additional config
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.
